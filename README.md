### Project tile - Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
### Description:
This is a supervised (classification) machine learning capstone project on Cardiovascular risk prediction given by [Alma Better](https://www.almabetter.com/).

### Problem statement:
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 18.6 million lives each year, which accounts for 33% of all the global deaths. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

It is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as possible so that management with counselling and medicines can begin.

Our main aim here is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).

### Note: Dataset is provided by the company, Alma Better.

### Dataset description:
The dataset is from ongoing cardiovascular study on people of the town Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patients information(Sex, Age, is_smoking, cigs_per_day, BP_Meds, Prevalent Stroke, Prevalent hyp, Diabetes, Tot Chol, Sys BP, Dia BP, BMI, Heart Rate)
### Attribute Information:
  * age - Patient's age.
  * education - Patient's education.
  * sex : gender(Male or Female).
  * is_smoking - currently patient is a smoker or not.
  * cigsPerDay - Cigarettes smoked per day by patient.
  * BPMeds - Patient taking BP meds or not.
  * prevalentStroke - If the patient has the history of stroke.
  * prevalentHyp - If the patient has the history of hypertention.
  * diabetes - Patient has diabetes or not.
  * totChol - Total cholestrol level.
  * sysBP - Blood Pressure measure.
  * diaBP - Blood Pressure measure.
  * BMI - Patient's body mass index.
  * heartRate - Heart Rate measure.
  * glucose - Glucose Level.
  * TenYearCHD - Future 10 year risk of CHD("0" means No and "1" means Yes.)
